			<h3>Visualization Narrative</h3>
			<p>
				This project follow the interactive slideshow narrative visualization structure. Each visualization is possible to be explored by users in each slide. The first slide has a little less interactivity then the second two slides, but users still are able to interact with the map by hovering over the states. 
			</p>
			<h3>Scenes</h3>
			<p>
				Each scene keeps the same consistency of having a menu, a paragraph explaining the overall purpose of the project, a paragraph explaining the purpose of the specific slide we are on, a chart and finally arrows allowing for navigation in the slide show. Each scene also uses the same looking tooltips for each chart to help keep consistency. Even though it is an interactive slide show I use different charts on each slide to help convey deeper understanding
of the data. 
			</p>
			<h3>Annotations</h3>
			<p>
				Annotations are represented by the different titles and axes labels on each page. Also the tooltips that appear when hovering are annotations for a given state. Finally the small paragraph explaining what each slide is for is another annotation. This paragraph is different on each slide because the chart is different on each slide. The axes on each slide are also different considering again that the charts are different on each slide. Lastly the tool tips follow the same format, i.e. conveying information for a given state. But the information varies depending on the slide/chart being looked at. 
			</p>
			<h3>Parameters</h3>
			<p>
				Each slide is linked to its next and its previous. Also each slide is accessible from the menu bar at the top. Depending on which scene you choose in the menu bar you will be taken to that respective scene. If you are following the order of the slide show, depending
on which slide you are currently on will determine which slide you are linked to next or previously. On the second slide, there is a selector that acts as a parameter. Depending on if you choose a region or not determines which states are displayed in the chart. Finally on slide three, there is another selector which helps you view states depending on if you only want to see states with a certain population size. 
			</p>
			<h3>Triggers</h3>
			<p>
				Clicking on a slide in the navigation bar, or clicking one of the next or previous arrows act as a trigger to determine which slide you look at. Another trigger is hovering over the various states in slide one or data points in slide two and three. When you hover this triggers a tool tip to appear and display information. Also when you hover over a state in slide one, the color of the state changes to help convey which state you are currently hovering over. Picking a region in slide two acts as a trigger because when a certain region is chosen, only a certain subset of states are then displayed in the given chart. Finally picking a population size in slide three is also a trigger because this also determines if a user sees only a subset of data in the given chart.
